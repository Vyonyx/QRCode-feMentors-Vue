## Overview
Creating a QR Code component was the first beginner challenge offered on Front End Mentors. I have used this opportunity to learn Vue and to sharpen my vanilla CSS skills.

### What I learned

Vue uses bindings to dynamically assign variables to html and component attributes. I ran into some trouble when trying to link an image path from the Card component's props to an image tag because I was not binding the prop correctly. In the end, the problem was resolved by adding a colon to the start of the img tag's src attribute ":src" which is a shorthand for "v-bind:src".
